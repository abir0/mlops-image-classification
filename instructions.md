MLOps End-to-End Coding Task: Image Classification

# Objective
Develop a multiclass image classification model with a full MLOps workflow, ensuring best practices in model development, training, deployment, monitoring, and containerization using Docker.

Dataset : The dataset contains 50 folders of images. Each folder represents a font name (e.g. AverageSans-Regular). Each image is a image of random text that is augmented in different ways. Note that: Image size varies.

# Steps
● Implement data preprocessing
● Save log of data statistics (e.g., class distribution, image dimensions)
and transformations.
● Develop a deep learning model (e.g., using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch) for image classification.
● Monitor key metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score).
● Log hyperparameters, loss values, and validation metrics.
● Save the trained model and relevant artifacts for deployment.
● Automate data ingestion, model training, and evaluation using a pipeline tool
● Log model predictions and compare them with actual labels (if available) to
assess real-time accuracy.
● Create a Docker image for the inference service
● Deploy the Dockerized service on a local machine

Instructions
● Build an end-to-end pipeline for classification task.
● Ensure that each stage follows MLOps best practices with a strong emphasis on model monitoring and containerization.
● Don’t use google colab as code editor.
● Please make GitHub public repo and share the link
● Kindly submit your skills assessment task, particularly if it remains incomplete.
